            On January 22, 2019, free "character refreshes" for the DST roster as well as paid DLC characters
            were announced to be released throughout 2019.[3] A total of four DLC characters were originally 
            announced, however, as of the 2020 Roadmap, Klei stated that they were not going to commit to a 
            specific number of new characters. Character refreshes continued in 2020, starting in March as in 
            the previous year[4] and ending in September. Refreshes and 1 DLC character were announced in the
            2021 Roadmap,[5] with 2021 refreshes beginning in April and ending in December.
